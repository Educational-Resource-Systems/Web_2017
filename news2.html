			<h1>Local Families &amp; Business Leaders Work Together For JDRF One Night Gala</h1>
			<img style="margin-top: 10px" src="img/Terry-Family-1024x675.jpg">
			<p>
				<i>Long Branch, NJ, April, 14, 2016</i> – Gregg, Debra, Ryan and Justin Terry will receive JDRF’s prestigious Family of the Year award during the organization’s
				15th Annual One Night Gala taking place on Saturday, June 4 at the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch. “Our family is truly humbled to receive this
				award as we’ve dedicated our lives to help JDRF find better treatments and a cure for type 1 diabetes. The medical advancements that we’ve experienced over the
				last 20 years&emdash;and in particular the improvement in the quality of life for our son Ryan, who was diagnosed at age 4 and is now 24 years old—have been remarkable,”
				said Gregg Terry, Owner and President of Educational Resource Systems, father, and caregiver.
			</p>
			<p>
				JDRF is also bestowing an honor to Dr. Santhosh Eapen and his pediatric endocrinology team from K. Hovnanian Children’s Hospital at Jersey Shore University
				Medical Center with their Healthcare Hero Award that recognizes their shared commitment to serve patients’ needs more deeply. “Dr. Eapen and his team are
				tremendous partners when it comes to serving our local type 1 diabetes community and we enjoy working with them to address the non-medical needs of their patients”
				said Jess Backofen, executive director of JDRF Central Jersey.
			</p>
			<p>
				More than 400 guests are expected to attend and proceeds will support life-changing research and local outreach programs that ease the burden a family
				endures after a new diabetes diagnosis. JDRF One Night will feature a top-notch live & silent auctions an unforgettable program and entertainment provided
				by Brian Kirk &amp; The Jirks.
			</p>
			<p>
				JDRF One Night co-chairs, Tracie Wilk of Short Hills and Donna Rovere of Red Bank are driving the success behind this year’s event. These two mothers of
				children with type 1 diabetes, along with their committee, have worked tirelessly to ensure the event not only meets, but exceeds its $500,000 goal and
				leaves guests feeling inspired about the work being done by JDRF. “Whether you’ve been directly impacted by diabetes or not, JDRF One Night is a chance to give
				back to our community and support a well-respected nonprofit health organization—one that works hand-in-hand with dedicated volunteers to find a cure for the
				1.25 million people living with type 1 diabetes,” said Donna Rovere.

				<b>About Type 1 Diabetes</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which a person’s pancreas loses the ability to produce insulin&mdsash;a hormone essential to turning food into energy.
				T1D strikes both children and adults suddenly and is unrelated to diet or lifestyle. It requires constant carbohydrate counting, blood-glucose testing,
				and lifelong dependence on injected insulin. With T1D, there are no days off and there is no cure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>About JDRF</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				JDRF (formerly “Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation”) is the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes (T1D) research. Our mission is to
				accelerate life-changing breakthroughs to cure, prevent, and treat T1D and its complications. To accomplish this, JDRF has invested nearly $2 billion
				since our inception. We are an organization built on a grassroots model of people connecting in their local communities; collaborating regionally
				for efficiency and broader fundraising impact; and uniting on a national stage to pool resources, passion, and energy. We collaborate with academic
				institutions, policymakers, and corporate and industry partners to develop and deliver a pipeline of innovative therapies to people living with T1D.
				Our staff and volunteers in the JDRF Central Jersey Chapter and in more than 100 locations throughout the United States and our 6 international affiliates
				are dedicated to advocacy, community engagement and our vision of a world without T1D. For more information,
				please visit <a href="http://jdrf.org">jdrf.org</a> or follow us on Twitter @JDRF.
