NOTES

-'clean html' folder holds unaltered versions of the html in the menus.js file.
The html in that file has an escape symbol at every line break so that it can be read properly by the javascript. 

-'menus.js' has two menu setups- one standard for wider widths, and one for iPad portrait view.
It checks at the start of the file for page width and uses that to choose.  

-index.html has script in the header that reloads the page on orientation change. 
There is also a check for screen width that determines footer sizing adjustments.

-Footer code has also been added to menus.js so it can be loaded separately like the header.
